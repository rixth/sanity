This is a simple layout & Makefile for an Arduino project.

Build file works as of Arduino 1.5.6-r2 with an Uno board on OS X.

You need to have the Arduino IDE installed (for tools, headers, etc). Have a look in the Makefile for various options.

If you want to use other libraries, you'll have to both reference them in your source, and include them in the build process via the Makefile.
